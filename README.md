# Visual Question-Answering
 The "Visual Question & Answering (VQA)" harnesses tools from Hugging Face to develop an advanced AI model that interprets and answers questions about images. By integrating state-of-the-art natural language processing with computer vision, this project enables the model to understand and respond to queries related to visual content. Leveraging Hugging Faceâ€™s pre-trained models and fine-tuning techniques, the system excels in providing accurate, context-aware answers. The VQA model is designed for applications in interactive AI, educational tools, and accessibility.
